# LOAN-PAYMENT-PREDICTION

This is a model that helps to predict whether or not a person will pay back their loan based on historical data, Tensor flow with keras API was used to develop the model.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

•	Used the Pandas info to do a quick exploration of the data which revealed that there are missing values in the data.

•	Performed a seaborn count plot to know how many loans were fully paid and charged off on our historical data.
